# MinimalLogging

## Rationale

As developers, adding log statements seems easy and risk-free. However, with hundreds of machines, collecting those log files can become quite a challenge, let alone making sense of the important information they contain. We set out to reduce logging to its essentials and explore optimisations not only in terms of disk space, but also runtime performance and even exposure. Leveraging ideas from well-known software related workflows, we will write a C++20 logging framework from scratch and highlight some surprises along the way.
